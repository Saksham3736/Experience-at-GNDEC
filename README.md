# MY EXPERIENCE AT GNDEC 
- __Day 1__
> INDUCTION PROGRAM DAY

My day started with a sleepless night. I woke up at 7:am and started getting dressed up. I went from my home at 8:15am and reached at exactly 8:50am. Then, I waited to meet someone I know earlier. But unfortunately I got no one. So. then, I went to a [hall]() where the kirtan and ardas was going to held. i took off my shoes and washed my hands. Then, I covered my head and moved inside the [hall](). The kiratan and ardas made me feel so good and relaxing.

It made me feel that I didn't choose this but Waheguru Ji had chosen it for me. So, with a brave heart and strong mind I attended it and came outside the [hall]() after it ended. Then I took the refreshments offered by the college which were really good. Then, I met my one friend who was in my class during 11th-12th in my [school](https://www.google.com/search?q=bvm+kithclu+nagar&rlz=1C1CHBF_enIN1051IN1051&oq=bvm+kithclu+nagar&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTISCAEQLhgNGK8BGMcBGIAEGI4FMgkIAhAAGA0YgAQyCQgDEAAYDRiABDIICAQQABgWGB4yDQgFEAAYhgMYgAQYigUyDQgGEAAYhgMYgAQYigUyDQgHEAAYhgMYgAQYigUyCggIEAAYgAQYogTSAQg3NjMwajBqNKgCALACAA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). After meeting him, I went to the [Auditorium](https://gndec.ac.in/cultural/?q=node/9). Before entering the auditorium, I got a file bag, which was for all students. In the bag, There was brochure about the college, an invitation letter for me, a pen and a notepad. I took it and went inside the auditorium.

The auditorium was very calm, pleasent and was creatively structured. Then, all teachers and seniors came up there. After it, Our respected Principle sir, [Dr. Sehijpal Singh Guru](https://fb.watch/tigo5j7WBQ/), Our Director sir, [NSET S.Inderpal Singh](https://fb.watch/tigpSmuCit/) along with our alumna [Er.Jiwandeep Singh](https://fb.watch/tigjZwZe3z/), PCS officer, came there to greet and interact with all of us. First, Our principal sir came and motivated us to make the best use of this platform. Then, Our director sir introduced us to the legendry and illustrious history of this [instituion](https://www.gndec.ac.in/), emphasizing its 100 years of shaping brilliant minds. He highlighted the first 36 years, which were dedicated in the establishment of this [instituion](https://www.gndec.ac.in/).

Then, our one of the alumni, now as a PCS officer, who was the "Guest Of Honor" of that day, illustrated us the imporatnce of "what", "how" and most imporant "My why". One of the great question which we all should ask from ourselves at the beginning of anything so that we can properly, carefully, whole heartedly and with a great self-confidence do the task we want to do. he explained us the real meaning of an __"ENGINEER"__ that is _creators_. As a creator, an engineer creates various things to solve a problem in very quick and creative way.\
He also made us feel about how significant is an _oppurtunity_.

He took out a 500 rupee note and ask all of us that whosever want that note can come forward and take the note with him/her. A boy raised his hand and came forward and took it and rest of us were shocked to see it. Then, sir illustrated that every oppurtunity, whether it is small or large, we should grab it on time. we all should be prepared for any kind of oppurtunity.\
Then one more alumna, [S.Rajeshwar Singh Sidhu](https://fb.watch/tigzIRdD9R/), SSP, Interacted with all of us with his wonderful experiences and stories. He emphasised the imporatnce of how GOD took test of all us and give us reward according to it throughout our life. He make us to feel it and told us to just keep your focus on yourself and keep improving yourself.

Then, the [Day 2 Of INDUCTION PROGRAM](https://fb.watch/tigAJvY2Z7/) got over.
